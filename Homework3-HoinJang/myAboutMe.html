            <h1><b>About me:</b></h1><br>
            <p>I am Hoin Jang, majoring in computer science senior year at U of m. I am from Gwangju,korea. I was in the US for about 4years, 
            and I had to go to the military service for a while in the middle,</p>

            <p>so I took a leave of absence from U of M for 2 years. However after I was discharged from the military, 
            I was thinking about which field of computer I would go into later,and I became interested in web development. so I have registered for the CSCI4131.</p>

            <p>I think that this class would be a good experience for the front-end and Back-end. While taking this class, I also want to learn about node js,Back-end, 
            and I want to work as a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> in the future.</p>

            <p>For this summer vacation, I just went back to my country, had fun with families but nothing special and, I just prepared
            for my algorithm interview.</p>
    
            <p><i> Thank you for taking a look at my webpage. Have a good one!</i></p>
