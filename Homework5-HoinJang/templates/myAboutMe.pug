            p
                | I am Hoin Jang, majoring in computer science senior year at U of m. I am from Gwangju,korea. I was in the US for about 4years,
                | and I had to go to the military service for a while in the middle,
            p  
                | so I took a leave of absence from U of M for 2 years. However after I was discharged from the military,
                | I was thinking about which field of computer I would go into later,and I became interested in web development. so I have registered for the CSCI4131.
            p
                | I think that this class would be a good experience for the front-end and Back-end. While taking this class, I also want to learn about node js,Back-end, 
                | and I want to work as a 
                strong full-stack developer
                |  in the future.
            p
                | For this summer vacation, I just went back to my country, had fun with families but nothing special and, I just prepared
                | for my algorithm interview.
